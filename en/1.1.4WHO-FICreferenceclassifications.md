###	WHO-FIC: Reference Classifications

Reference classifications cover the main parameters of the health system, such as death and 
disease (ICD), disability, functioning, and health (ICF) and health interventions (ICHI). WHO-FIC 
reference classifications are a product of international agreements. They have achieved broad 
acceptance and official agreement for use and are approved and recommended as guidelines 
for international reporting on health. They may be used as models for the development or 
revision of other classifications. The three Reference classifications are:

1.	International Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems (ICD)
2.	International Classification of Functioning, Disability & Health (ICF)
3.	International Classification Health Intervention (ICHI)

####	Disability and Functioning – ICF

The ICF is the WHO's framework for measuring health and functioning/disability at both the 
individual and population levels. While the ICD classifies diseases and causes of death, the ICF 
classifies health domains. ICD and ICF together provide tools to capture the full picture of 
health. 

The ICF classifies health and health-related states in two parts. Part one addresses functioning 
and disability, described from the perspectives of the body, the individual, and society, and is 
composed of two components: Body Functions and Structures and Activities and Participation 
life areas.  Part two covers contextual factors and has two components: Environmental Factors 
and Personal Factors (currently not classified in ICF), since an individual's functioning occurs in a 
context. 

Functioning is a generic term for body functions (e.g. memory), body structures (e.g. occipital 
lobe), and activities and participation life areas (e.g. walking, engaging in paid work). It denotes 
the neutral aspects of the interaction between an individual (related to the individual’s health) 
and that individual's contextual factors (environmental and personal factors). 

Disability is an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. 
It denotes the negative aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a health 
condition) and that individual's contextual factors (environmental and personal factors). 
Disabilities are envisioned as a continuum and therefore the ICF and the codes within it do not 
confer an international binary status of disabled/not disabled. Levels of disability can be used 
descriptively in clinical settings when formulating a case. Program and policy decision-makers 
can apply the ICF and specify their own standards for the level of disability as eligibility criteria 
that are relevant for specific purposes. 

ICF includes the following other definitions:
- *Body functions* are the physiological functions of body systems (including psychological 
functions).
-	*Body structures* are anatomical parts of the body such as organs, limbs and their 
components.
-	*Impairments* are problems in body function or structure such as a significant deviation or 
loss.
-	*Activity* is the execution of a task or action by an individual.
-	*Activity limitations* are difficulties an individual may have in executing activities.
-	*Participation* is involvement in a life situation.
-	*Participation restrictions* are problems an individual may experience in involvement in life 
situations.
-	*Environmental factors* make up the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which 
people live and conduct their lives.

ICF includes codes for Body Functions (b), Body Structures (s), Activities and Participation (d), 
and Environmental Factors (e).

ICF codes are only complete with the presence of a qualifier, which denotes the level of 
health (i.e. severity of the problem from ‘no problem’ to ‘complete problem’). Without 
qualifiers, codes have no inherent meaning. The ICF acknowledges that every human being can 
experience a decrement in health and thereby experience some disability. Disabilities can be 
temporary and may be brief (such as staying home from work for a few days with the flu); they 
can also be chronic or permanent and may fluctuate in severity over time.

####	Interventions – ICHI

Intervention classifications are designed to include all kinds of health interventions for 
treatment, diagnosis, or prevention. The International Classification of Health Interventions 
(ICHI) includes interventions across all functional sectors of the health system, covering acute 
care, primary care, rehabilitation, assistance with functioning, prevention, public health, and 
ancillary services. Interventions provided by all types of providers have been included. The 
importance of describing and classifying health interventions has long been understood. An 
International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was published by WHO in 1978 
but was not maintained. ICHI is much broader than the former ICPM because it includes the full 
range of health interventions. Development of ICHI began in 2007, as a joint effort of the WHO-
FIC Network and WHO. Its structure has been completed, an alpha version published in 2012 
and a beta version in 2015. Finalisation is planned for 2019.

**Table 1:** *Definitions and terms used in creation of ICHI classifications.*

|**Axes**|**Inclusions**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|The **Target axis** contains the entities on which the action is carried out. |Anatomy, Human function, Person or client, Group or population||
|The **Action axis** is defined as a deed which is done by an actor to a target during a health care intervention. |Investigation, Treating, Managing, Informing, Assisting, Preventing||
|The **Means axis** contains the entities describing the processes and methods by which the action is carried out. |**Approach**: the process by which the target of the action is accessed|open, endoscopic|
||**Technique** used as part of the action|radiation, magnetic resonance|
||**Method** describing how the action is undertaken|law enforcement, method of transport.|

Other attributes of interventions are included as 'Means' in the ICHI Content Model. The 
content of the axes has been restricted to attributes that are common to many interventions. In 
particular:

-	Devices have not been included as an axis because most interventions do not 
involve a device and devices change rapidly
-	Drugs or other substances administered through an intervention are classified elsewhere 
(ICD, The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification with Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD), 
INN).

The coding system comprises a 7-character category structure for the three axes:

-	Three letters for the Target
-	Two letters for the Action
-	Two letters for the Means

ICHI is a flat file comprising valid 7 letter combinations of the three axes. For each intervention included in ICHI, the appropriate 7 letter combination is identified. Not every possible combination of the three axes represents a valid ICHI domain.

####	WHO-FIC: Derived Classifications

Derived classifications are often tailored for use at the national or international level or for use 
in a particular specialty. Derived classifications are based upon reference classifications (ICD, 
ICF, ICHI). Derived classifications may be prepared by:
-	adopting the reference classification structure and classes
-	providing additional detail beyond that provided by the reference classification, or through rearrangement or by aggregation of items from one or more reference classifications.

ICD-11 has specialty linearizations that are derived from the common foundation. These include a version for dermatology, one for primary care and one for mental health. Others may follow.

####	Related Classifications

Related classifications are included in WHO-FIC to describe important aspects of health or the 
health system not covered by reference or derived classifications. Related classifications are:

- International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC)
- International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI)
- Technical aids for persons with disabilities (ISO9999)
- The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification with Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD)
- The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP)
