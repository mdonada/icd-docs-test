**How to use this Reference Guide**

This Reference Guide for ICD-11 is divided into 3 Parts. While each Part will contain information valuable for your understanding and use of ICD-11, each has been created to be relevant to your primary purpose for coming to the Guide.

If you are looking to gain a **general, broad understanding of ICD-11**, with little or no prior experience with ICD, we suggest you start with **Part 1**.

If you are looking to **understand how codes are created**, and the details of the organisation and statistics behind ICD-11, we suggest you start with **Part 2**.

If you are already familiar with ICD, having used especially ICD-10, we suggest you start with **Part 3** to see **what is new (and what has not changed) in ICD-11**.
